        <p>[The room as before. All the doors stand open. The lamp is still burning
        on the table. It is dark out of doors; there is only a faint glow from
        the conflagration in the background to the left.]</p>

        <p>[MRS. ALVING, with a shawl over her head, stands in the conservatory,
        looking out. REGINA, also with a shawl on, stands a little behind her.]</p>
            
        <h4>MRS. ALVING</h4><br> 
        <p>The whole thing burnt!--burnt to the ground!</p>

        <h4>REGINA</h4><br> 
        <p>The basement is still burning.</p>

        <h4>MRS. ALVING</h4><br> 
        <p>How is it Oswald doesn't come home? There's nothing to be saved.</p>

        <h4>REGINA</h4><br>
        <p>Should you like me to take down his hat to him?</p>

        <h4>MRS. ALVING</h4><br> 
        <p>Has he not even got his hat on?</p>

        <h4>REGINA</h4><br> 
        <p><span style="color:red">[Pointing to the hall.]</span> No; there it hangs.</p>

        <h4>MRS. ALVING</h4><br> 
        <p>Let it be. He must come up now. I shall go and look for him
        myself. <span style="color:red"></span>[She goes out through the garden door.]</p>

        <h4>MANDERS</h4><br> 
        <p><span style="color:red">[Comes in from the hall.]</span> 
        Is not Mrs. Alving here?</p>

        <h4>REGINA</h4><br> 
        <p>She has just gone down the garden.</p>

        <h4>MANDERS</h4><br> 
        <p>This is the most terrible night I ever went through.</p>

        <h4>REGINA</h4><br> 
        <p>Yes; isn't it a dreadful misfortune, sir?</p>

        <h4>MANDERS</h4><br> 
        <p>Oh, don't talk about it! I can hardly bear to think of it.</p>

        <h4>REGINA</h4><br> 
        <p>How can it have happened--?</p>

        <h4>MANDERS</h4><br> 
        <p>Don't ask me, Miss Engstrand! How should _I_ know? Do you,
        too--? Is it not enough that your father--?</p>

        <h4>REGINA</h4><br> 
        <p>What about him?</p>

        <h4>MANDERS</h4><br>
        <p>Oh, he has driven me distracted--</p>

        <h4>ENGSTRAND</h4><br>
        <p><span style="color:red">[Enters through the hall.]</span> Your Reverence--</p>

        <h4>MANDERS</h4><br> 
        <p><span style="color:red">[Turns round in terror.]</span>
        Are you after me here, too?</p>

        <h4>ENGSTRAND</h4><br>
        <p>Yes, strike me dead, but I must--! Oh, Lord! what am I
        saying? But this is a terrible ugly business, your Reverence.</p>

        <h4>MANDERS</h4><br>
        <p><span style="color:red">[Walks to and fro.]</span> Alas! alas!</p>

        <h4>REGINA</h4><br> 
        <p>What's the matter?</p>

        <h4>ENGSTRAND</h4><br> 
        <p>Why, it all came of this here prayer-meeting, you see.
        <span style="color:red">[Softly.]</span> The bird's limed, my girl. 
        <span style="color:red">[Aloud.]</span> And to think it should be
        my doing that such a thing should be his Reverence's doing!</p>

        <h4>MANDERS</h4><br> 
        <p>But I assure you, Engstrand--</p>

        <h4>ENGSTRAND</h4><br>
        <p>There wasn't another soul except your Reverence as ever laid
        a finger on the candles down there.</p>
